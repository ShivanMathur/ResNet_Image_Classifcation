# ResNet_Image_Classifcation

## Problem Statement:

- The project's objective is to utilize the ResNet-18 architecture to classify images within a dataset consisting of three categories: Dogs, Cars, and Food.
- 

## Implementation:

## ResNet-18 Architecture:


## Optimization Techniques Used:

  1. Regularization: L2 regularization has been applied to reduce overfitting of the model, by adding a weight decay parameter of 1e-5 to the optimizer.
  2. Batch Normalization: Batch Normalization has been applied after layers to combat overfitting of the ResNet architecture model.



## Result Analysis:

- Model Performance without Optimization Techniques:
  - Accuracy and Loss:
    - The test accuracy of the model without implementing optimization techniques was 82%.
    - The test loss of the model was 0.73.
 
- Model Performance with Optimization Techniques:
  - Accuracy:
    - After applying L2 regularization, the test accuracy increased to 88.72%.
    - After applying Batch Normalization layers, the test accuracy increased to approximately 90%.
  - Loss:
    - After applying L2 regularization, the test loss reduced to 0.66.
    - After applying Batch Normalization, the test loss reduced to 0.64.
